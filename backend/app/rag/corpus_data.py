The lowest tier likely doesn't include the features that create stickiness (integrations, collaboration, automations). Fix options: (1) move key sticky features down a tier, (2) eliminate the lowest tier and make Professional the entry point, (3) create a guided upgrade path when users hit the value ceiling.",
